rpcapr - Put pcap in your R.

This is an R library for capturing, reading, and analyzing libpcap packet
 capture files. My initial goal is to be able to open an existing pcap file
 and import it into R as a data frame. Future development goals are to allow R
 to write a pcap file and to perform live capture.

 Tools for working with libpcap packet capture files.
